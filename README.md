## Brief Description of Project 

The goal of our project is to design and develop an ERP system that will provide appropriate solutions for the existing problems of Jiffy Products PVT LTD. Among the large number of sectors of the company we have decided to mainly focus on customer, employee, leave, order, finance, inventory, supplier delivery and factory management. Upon doing a thorough requirement analysis and gathering information we realized that most of the work is done manually as well as the challenges and inconveniences faced by the users of the current manual approach. After examining these problems, we decided to develop a system that fills existing gaps by automating the above-mentioned aspects. We have decided to digitalize customer management so that a customer can register and then login to the system and make orders, check order status easily.
